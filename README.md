## 🌟 Why **Mixtral-8x7b-32768**?
This project uses **Groq's Mixtral-8x7b-32768** model, an advanced mixture of experts model that balances **speed, accuracy, and efficiency**. It was chosen because:
- ✅ **High Accuracy:** It effectively detects and corrects grammatical errors while preserving context.
- ⚡ **Optimized Performance:** Provides quick responses, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- 💡 **Better Context Understanding:** Unlike smaller models, Mixtral-8x7b-32768 excels at maintaining sentence coherence and nuance.
- 📚 **Scalability:** Can handle complex and lengthy text inputs efficiently.

---
## 🌍 How This Project Works
1. The user enters text that needs correction.
2. The app sends the text to **Groq's LLM API**, which processes the input using advanced language models.
3. The LLM analyzes the text for grammar, spelling, and contextual errors.
4. The corrected text is then returned and displayed to the user.

### 🧠 How LLM Works in This Project
- **Text Input:** User provides raw text in English or Hindi.
- **System Prompt:** The LLM is instructed to act as a grammar and spell checker.
- **Processing:** The model detects errors and improves sentence structure while keeping the original meaning intact.
- **Output:** A refined and corrected version of the input is returned.

---
## 📝 System Prompt Used
The model is instructed with a carefully designed **system prompt** to ensure accurate and context-aware corrections. The prompts used are:

### **English Prompt**
```plaintext
You are a highly advanced grammar and spell checker for English. Correct the following text while maintaining its meaning. Ensure proper grammar, sentence structure, and context-aware spelling corrections.
```

### **Hindi Prompt**
```plaintext
आप एक उच्च स्तरीय व्याकरण और वर्तनी सुधारक हैं, जो हिंदी भाषा के लिए बनाया गया है। दिए गए पाठ को सही करें, व्याकरण, वाक्य संरचना और संदर्भ के अनुसार वर्तनी को ठीक करें, जबकि मूल अर्थ को बनाए रखें।
```

### 🔄 Why These Prompts Are Used
- ✅ **Ensures Precision:** The prompts explicitly ask the LLM to focus on correcting grammar and spelling while maintaining context.
- 🌐 **Supports Multiple Languages:** The `{language}` placeholder allows dynamic adaptation for English and Hindi.
- 💠 **Preserves Meaning:** The instruction ensures that the original intent of the text remains intact.
- 🎯 **Optimized for LLM Processing:** It minimizes ambiguity, making the model’s responses more predictable and reliable.
